My project is a personal application development that showcases who I am and what I do. It is a way to introduce myself to the world and to share my passion and vision. The application consists of four main sections: historical background, education level, hobbies and contact. In each section, I provide some information about myself, such as where I come from, what I study, what I enjoy and how to reach me. The application also has a user-friendly and attractive design, thanks to the help of Sitra, who assisted me in creating the UI/UX. The application is a reflection of my personality and my goals. It is a project that I am proud of and that I hope you will like.
