I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Sitra, 
a computer science student who helped me a lot throughout my project. 
She was very generous with her time and expertise, 
and she assisted me in designing my personal application UI/UX. 
She was always supportive, creative and professional. 
She gave me valuable feedback and suggestions, and she taught me many things. 
She made my project better and easier. 
I appreciate her friendship and collaboration. All rights reserved for her.
